# Fundamentos de NLP

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science that deals with the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages. It is concerned with the understanding, interpretation, and generation of human language. NLP has applications in many areas, including machine translation, text mining, and question answering.

NLTK is a free, open-source Python library for natural language processing. It provides a wide range of natural language processing tools and resources, including:

- Tokenizers for splitting text into words and sentences
- Part-of-speech taggers for identifying the parts of speech of words
- Named entity recognizers for identifying named entities in text
- Text classifiers for classifying text into different categories
- WordNet, a lexical database that provides information - about words, such as their definitions, synonyms, and Antonyms

NLTK is a powerful tool for natural language processing. It can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as:

- Tokenizing text
- Identifying the parts of speech of words
- Identifying named entities in text
- Classifying text into different categories
- Extracting information from text
- Generating text

NLTK is a great resource for anyone who is interested in natural language processing. It is easy to use and provides a wide range of tools and resources.

Here are some of the basic concepts of NLP that are covered in NLTK:

- Tokenization: This is the process of breaking down a piece of text into smaller units, such as words, phrases, or sentences.
- Part-of-speech tagging: This is the process of assigning a part of speech to each word in a sentence.
- Named entity recognition: This is the process of identifying named entities in a piece of text, such as people, places, organizations, and dates.
- Text classification: This is the process of assigning a category to a piece of text.
- Information extraction: This is the process of extracting information from a piece of text.
- Text generation: This is the process of creating new text, such as summarizing a piece of text or writing a creative story.

NLTK is a powerful tool for natural language processing. It can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, text classification, information extraction, and text generation. If you are interested in natural language processing, then NLTK is a great resource to learn from.
